# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Statistical analysis of vehicle data using R

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
This data analysis was conducted to assist an auto manaufacturing team in progressing in the production of a new vehicle. The MechaCar has been having troubles during it's production process and the data is being tested to provide insights that may help the team. 

### Summary
#### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - The vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD variables provided a non-random amount of variance in the dataset. 
  - The slope shouldn't be zero. This canbe determined using the p-value. 
  - Since the RSquared value is above 70%, this means that the model will accurately predict the values at least 70% of the time.

#### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  - Lot 1 and Lot 2 both meet the design specifications; however, Lot 3 displays great variance and does not neet the specifications. You can see this displayed in the image below.
